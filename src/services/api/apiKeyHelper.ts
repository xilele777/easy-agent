/**
 * apiKeyHelper — resolve an API token by running a user-configured script.
 *
 * Some environments don't keep a static token in the environment; instead a
 * short-lived token is minted by a helper (vault CLI, cloud auth, etc.). The
 * `apiKeyHelper` setting points at such a script; we run it and use its stdout
 * as the bearer token.
 *
 * Security: the helper is EXECUTED, so it is read only from TRUSTED settings
 * sources (user / flag / policy, plus project/local once the folder is
 * trusted). An untrusted repo can't silently run a script or redirect auth.
 *
 * Precedence: an explicit `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment always
 * wins; the helper only fills in a token when none is set.
 *
 * Reference: source code's `apiKeyHelper` in the settings schema + its
 * credential resolution path.
